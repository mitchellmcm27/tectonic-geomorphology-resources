## Maps

**[SEGEMAR geologic maps (Argentina, Hojas Geol√≥gicas)](http://repositorio.segemar.gov.ar/handle/308849217/69)** The official repository for geologic maps of Argentina, 1:250,000 scale.

**[Catedra de Geologia Argentina](http://www.criba.edu.ar/geolarg/topograficas.html)** Geologic and topographic maps of Argentina. Area maps from the Geographic Atlas of Argentina.

**[Designing basemaps](http://www.mitchell-mcmillan.com/blog/2018/11/12/designing-basemaps)** A guide for creating your own basemaps in GIS. Useful for field work in remote areas.

## Data, models

**[PaleoDEM](http://www.earthbyte.org/paleodem-resource-scotese-and-wright-2018/)** Reconstructed topography and bathymetry for various geologic time periods.

**[TRMM - Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission - processed data](http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/~bodo/TRMM/)** Monthly and annual gridded rainfall time series.

**[OCTOPUS](https://earth.uow.edu.au/)** Cosmogenic Isotope and Luminescence Database (University of Wollongong). Map and download erosion rate data.

**[WorldClim](http://www.worldclim.org/)** Gridded climatic data with ~1 km resolution. [More info in Fick and Hijmans, 2017.]({{ site.baseurl }}/Fick_et_al-2017-International_Journal_of_Climatology.pdf)

## Mapping tools

**[GeoMapApp](http://www.geomapapp.org/)** Explore, map and plot geologic data. Many important datasets are linked and can be loaded instantly. Examples: DEMs, gravity anomalies, earthquake locations.

**[Qgis2threejs](https://github.com/minorua/Qgis2threejs)** Export 3-d maps from QGIS to be viewed on the web. Here's an [example](https://mitchellmcm27.github.io/phd-antofalla/exports/southern-fraile-threejs/index.html).

**[GPlates](https://www.gplates.org/)** "Interactive visualization of plate tectonics". Powerful geology-oriented GIS based on plate-tectonic reconstructions.

**[TopoJSON](https://github.com/topojson/topojson)** A geospatial vector data format that encodes the topology of shapes (rings and arcs). Especially useful for geologic mapping, where polygons representing units commonly share borders representing contacts. The format also reduces file size over ESRI Shapefiles and the more common GeoJSON, making it ideal for the web. [Here's an example of a digital geologic map using TopoJSON.](http://bl.ocks.org/rclark/5779893)

## Matlab

**[TopoToolbox](https://topotoolbox.wordpress.com/)** Topographic analysis in Matlab. Hillshading, flow routing, longitudinal profile analysis...

**[Topographic Analysis Kit (TAK)](https://github.com/amforte/Topographic-Analysis-Kit)** "A series of MATLAB functions that build upon the functionality of TopoToolbox"

**[mGstat](http://mgstat.sourceforge.net/)** Geostatistics, especially kriging.

**[ternplot](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/2299-alchemyst-ternplot)** Ternary plots in Matlab.

**[CRONUS](https://bitbucket.org/cronusearth/cronus-calc/src/master/)** Cosmogenic dating of surface exposure. "This directory contains the MATLAB code and data sets for the CRONUS project production rate models, production rate calibration, surface sample calculator and depth profile calculator."

## Geo- & thermochronology

**[Arizona Laserchron Center (ALC)](https://sites.google.com/a/laserchron.org/laserchron/home)** Valuable information, guidelines, and tools. Tips for sampling in the field, laboratory procedures, spreadsheets, etc.

**CRONUS** see above
